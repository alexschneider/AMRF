<h2 id="Interprocess_Communication">Interprocess Communication</h2>
<p>Threads share a common address space, while processes have separate memory, but<br>both allow code to be executed simultaneously on multiple cores or when another<br>thread is blocking.</p>
<p>Clients and servers interact to create a distributed system, a client asks for<br>something and a server provides it. There are many available abstractions to<br>reduce complexity, these are called middleware.</p>
<h3 id="OSI_model">OSI model</h3>
<p>There are 7 layers of network communication,</p>
<p>Layer 7 - application layer, highest level, most abstract regarding user<br>applications.</p>
<p>Layer 6 - Presentation layer - rendering the application layer or otherwise<br>processing received data into a format that the application layer can handle</p>
<p>Layer 5 - Session layer - Protocol for how to interact between two systems and<br>maintain a connection state</p>
<p>Layer 4 - Transport layer - Determine how to send the data between two systems,<br>handle error correction, etc.</p>
<p>Layer 3 - network layer - Determines the route that packets take, how they<br>navigate between the two machines</p>
<p>Layer 2 - Data link layer - Converts bits into frames and adds error correction</p>
<p>Layer 1 - Physical layer - how the packets actually travel over the hardware and<br>get from location 1 to location 2.</p>
<h3 id="Transport_layer_protocols">Transport layer protocols</h3>
<p>UDP/IP - packets aren’t necessarily ordered and error corrected - program needs<br>to determine what order packets belong in and if there were any errors</p>
<p>TCP/IP - lost data is retransmitted and ordered, and duplicates are rejected</p>
<h3 id="Sockets">Sockets</h3>
<p>Sockets are integrated in the unix OS and used for interprocess communication.</p>
<p>Stream sockets - tcp/ip<br>Datagram socket - udp/ip</p>
<p>Client creates socket binds it to a port and connects to a sever, which has<br>created a socket and bound it to a port and is capable of receiving.</p>
<h3 id="Remote_procedure_calls">Remote procedure calls</h3>
<p>Clients and servers may not run on the same machine in a distributed system - so<br>procedure calls can be made over a network, rather than dealing with shared<br>memory.</p>
<p>Remote procedure calls block clients until they receive the result or a message<br>from the server, but if there are crashes, they are not handled gracefully.</p>
<p>To work around that problem, client stubs abstract the call so it behaves like a<br>local procedure call. Similarly, server stubs handle messages and abstract the<br>procedure call so it appears that it came from the local system.</p>
<p>The stubs need to resolve differences between the two systems as far as their<br>architecture goes, and to resolve various network and other failures (which may<br>be application specific - e.g. <em>at least once</em>, <em>at most once</em> or<br><em>exactly once</em>.</p>
<p>One such example of RPCs is Sun’s open Network Computing RPC, which<br>automatically generates server and client stubs to handle things.</p>
<p>A generalization of RPC is remote method invocation - objects that live on a<br>server and are referred to by clients, rather than copied to them.</p>
<h3 id="Message_passing">Message passing</h3>
<p>Most distributed systems are implemented by message passing, located above<br>tcp/ip or udp/ip layer, but below application layer.</p>
<p>Messages can be either transient or persistent.</p>
<p>Transient messages are messages that don’t live around if they’re not received,<br>persistent messages are messages that keep on trying until they’re received.</p>
<h3 id="Web_services">Web services</h3>
<p>Many web services utilize these communications with SOAP - simple object access<br>protocol, and others, over XML interfaces.</p>
<p>This allows for web applications to dynamically access endpoints given from web<br>servers.</p>
<h3 id="Cloud_computing">Cloud computing</h3>
<p>Many distributed networks are closely bound to cloud computing in this day and<br>age. This allows people with scalable systems to pay only what they use, and<br>average hourly prices are rather low.</p>
<h3 id="MapReduce">MapReduce</h3>
<p>Map applies a function to all elements in a list in parallel, and reduce takes<br>the output of a mapping operation and compiles it to a final result.</p>
<p>Map reduce uses key value pairs. It then compiles all values associated with<br>each key into one single value for that key.</p>
<p>MapReduce key values can’t necessarily be used for many parallel<br>algorithms, because these tasks make it difficult to break down to a simple<br>single mapping and reducing lambda, so they must be chained together to work.</p>
<p>See below for an example:</p>
<p><img src="mapreduce.png" alt="Map Reduce Example from ASU"></p>
<h3 id="Hadoop">Hadoop</h3>
<p>Hadoop is an open source implementation that the author of this blog is<br>emulating in his Map Reduce framework. It abstracts the communication between<br>nodes and allows the developer to focus on writing distributed code. </p>
<p>It uses a master-slave architecture, with the master receiving and dispatching<br>the job over Hadoop Distributed File System, which travel to all the slave<br>nodes, which all contribute computational power to solving to the problem.<br>When done, the slaves communicate back to the master with the result, and the<br>master reduces the data into more manageable chunks. </p>
<p>Slaves can also act like masters, and further subdivide the problem. </p>
<p>Failures are automatically handled by the system and rescheduled. </p>
<h3 id="Mobile_Agent">Mobile Agent</h3>
<p>Another method of communication between processes. </p>
<p>A mobile agent is code that migrates from one machine to another, and brings<br>along with it bits of data that it needs to do its job. </p>
<p>This offers more flexibility when determining the communication process, which<br>with RPCs only allows blocking or otherwise waiting until the procedure call is<br>finished, and then processing the results on the client. </p>
<h2 id="Problems">Problems</h2>
<h4 id="2-2-">2.2.</h4>
<p>Net banking allows one to interact with the banking system remotely. In order<br>for me to pay my bills with net banking, I first need to send information to my<br>bank, with my web browser acting as a client, and the bank acting as a server.<br>Then, my bank needs to connect with the national banking framework as a client<br>to tell it how much money it is sending and where. Finally, the national banking<br>framework communicates with the utility company’s bank and then that bank<br>communicates with the utility company. At the end of all that, I would get a<br>receipt from the utility company confirming payment. </p>
<h4 id="2-6-">2.6.</h4>
<p>Instant messaging can work in multiple ways. It can either be a centralized<br>server or a peer to peer network. </p>
<p>For a centralized server, my client would need to communicate to the central<br>server with a message and an address. The server would then need to resolve the<br>address of my friend and send my message to him. Finally, depending on the type<br>of client, I would receive a read receipt. </p>
<p>For a peer to peer communication, I would need to somehow already know my<br>friend’s address (such as his mobile number). If that were the case, I can route<br>over normal backbones to communicate with him directly, rather than having to<br>use a server as a go-between. </p>
