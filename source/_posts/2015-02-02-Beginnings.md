# Hello

I'm going to start off by describing myself and my motivation and goals for the
course. I'm a Junior Computer Science major at Loyola Marymount University,
taking a Distributed Systems course as independent study (CMSI 499). I've been
interested in problems of big data and distributed systems for a while, so I
figured that this course would be an excellent survey of the field. 

In addition, I'm going to be implementing a minimal version of Hadoop using
Rust, because I like to challenge myself. I do know a little bit of Rust, but
I've got a fair amount to learn as a part of this course. 

My main coursework should be finished over the next couple of weeks, and then
I'll get started on my map reduce framework. This should be interesting.
