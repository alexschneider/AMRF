## Models for communication

Communication is fairly complex for distributed systems, and needs to cover a
wide variety of domain specific tasks. Rather than reinventing the wheel every
time, we use an already designed and developed model. 

Models abstract network, IPC, security, error handling, and other things. They
can be applied to a range of platforms. 

Interprocess communication is important in distributed systems. The two models
handling this are message passing and shared memory

### Message passing model

![Message Passing from UIowa](message_passing.png)

Message passing can be represented as a directed graph as seen above. The
green circles are the processes, and the red squares are the routers. 

Each node can perform an internal action, communicate with other nodes, accept
external input, or produce external output.

Each channel (the arrows between the nodes) can carry a message. These messages
are point to point, meaning that they go directly from one node to another
without being received by other nodes. 

We assume reliable networks here. 

#### Channel axioms
1. Every message sent is received
2. Every message has a finite propagation delay with no upper bound
3. Each channel is a queue. 

In order to ensure that our axioms behave, we need to have protocols in place
and abstract them in our application layer, as to not let our distributed
framework worry about them. 

Channels can hold either a finite or an infinite amount of messages - for finite
messages, the channel will be full and a send will block. For the most part, the
limit is so large we can treat them as infinite. 

#### Synchrony
It is difficult to keep two systems in sync, because clock drift is inevitable.
Likewise, processes are rarely synchronized even on the same system, interrupts
causing even synchronized processes to behave poorly. Proper scheduling lets us
work around this issue on single systems, but this is impossible on distributed
systems. 

As a result, waiting for two processes to sync up is nearly impossible, so we
use asynchronous communication between distributed processes, which means that
there need not be coordination between senders and receivers of messages, the
receiver will pick up a message whenever it gets around to it. 

In the case that synchronization is required, handshaking is needed to ensure
that both the sender and receiver are ready to parse the message. 

#### Realtime systems

Systems where there needs to be deterministic behavior for applications running
on it. 

### Shared variable model

Certain parts of the process memory space overlap, which allows for direct
access of memory locations. This reduces the space complexity, because only a
single copy of the shared program state needs to be stored, rather than
replicating the program state across multiple processes. 

This is difficult for distributed systems, but many of them support an
abstraction for sharing virtual address space between computers called *DSM*,
which lives on top of message passing. This allows the programmer not to have to
worry about synchronizing the state of programs prior to doing computations. 

There are two models:

#### State reading model
![State Reading Model from UIowa](state_reading.png)

Any process can read the state of its neighbors, but can only update its own
state. 

#### Link register model
![Linked Register Model from UIowa](link_register.png)

Processes share a register that contains common states, and they can each read
from and write to the register, but cannot access any other processes directly.
The registers are red boxes in the above picture. This has the advantage of
being able to hide a program's state and decide how much each program wants to
share. 

#### Linda
Programs collaborate by depositing tuples and withdrawing them based on pattern
matching. Withdrawing is synchronous, depositing is asynchronous. 

### Mobile agents
Network bandwidth can be saved by doing processing on the server and reducing
the amount of data that needs to be sent back. 

### Model relationships
Two models are equivalent when they have the same types of properties and
operations that can be preformed, and they can easily be implemented in each
other. 

A model is stronger than another when the second requires more than one
operation to emulate the firsts operation $\forall$ operations $\in$ the first
model. A weaker model is the inverse.
